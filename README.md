# Project-2

I created a text-based app that calculated monthly interest with and without monthly deposits, then displayed the amount of interested accrued to the user to help them learn about investing. I feel like I could have done a better job making the program modular, and the way I chose to divide the program into functions didn't feel really great. However, I think using a for-loop to compound interest was a decent way to implement the equation we were given. It would have been more efficient to use some other equations I found online that could have calculated compound interest over a year though. Managing UI, loops, and functions will all be transferable to any other projects or work I would do, and I didn't use any outside resources to write this project.  I also should have done some sort of validation for the user's input though, because they can crash the program with illegal input. Security wise that's probably a major issue.
